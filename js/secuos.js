Our joint studies reach far beyond the traditional reliability modelling studies and help to bridge cultural, corporate and technical gaps.", "A key benefit of such joint studies is that they build a discussion platform between the parties, thereby facilitating the agreement of key project assumptions and providing a means to identify, agree and develop win-win development alternatives with significant improvements of capital expenditure and project economics. These studies foster agreement between the up-and downstream project teams, adding value through global optimisation of the integrated system and strengthening the credibility of the project's ability to deliver.", "The integrated studies capture value by design optimisation and they also provide an excellent starting point for the subsequent establishment, just prior to the start of operations, of the ARTIS Live application. The model, data and documentation should then be part of the project documentation and the hand-over from the project development to the operations.

The model is used to optimise the value chain, on a time-dependent basis, taking full account of variable production capacities. The model links the planned and unplanned downtime of the facilities and the operating flexibility to the production availability of the integrated system. It is calibrated against the historical field performance at component level and validated against the historical production availability of the integrated system.", "This results in an integrated model that can be used to optimise the timing of the future development, the capacity margins and the project development plans and, for existing operations, to justify maximum utilization of the production facilities and identify opportunities for additional contractual commitments."]

The paper explains how an ARTIS production availability model has been used to identify how best to increase the system performance of the sea water cooling system in a refinery. A reliable power supply system was created by adding additional on-site generating capacity.",
